UNSIGNED    Specifies unsigned numbers

Integers:

TINYINT     1 byte - It can store numbers from -128 to 127 (0 - 255 for UNSIGNED)
SMALLINT    2 bytes - Range from -32 768 to 32 767 (0 - 65535)
MEDIUMINT   3 bytes - Range from -8 388 608 to 8 388 607 (0 - 16777215)
INT         4 bytes - Range from -2 147 483 648 to 2 147 483 647 (0 - 4294967295)
BIGINT      8 bytes - Range from -9 223 372 036 854 775 808 to 9 223 372 036 854 775 807 (0 - 18446744073709551615)

Floats:

FLOAT       Small-precision Floating-Point Type represent approximate numeric data values
DOUBLE      Double-precision Floating-Point Type represent approximate numeric data values
REAL        Synonym for DOUBLE
DECIMAL     Fixed-Point Type  store exact numeric data values
NUMERIC     Synonym for DECIMAL

    HINT: Because floating-point values are approximate and not stored
    as exact values, attempts to treat them as exact in comparisons
    may lead to problems

Strings:

CHAR        When values are stored, they are right-padded with spaces
            to the specified length. When CHAR values are retrieved,
            trailing spaces are removed
VARCHAR     Values are variable-length strings
            The length can be specified as a value from 0 to 65,535
TINYTEXT    Can store no more than 255 characters
TEXT        Can store no more than 65 535 characters
MEDIUMTEXT  Can store no more than 16 777 215 characters
LONGTEXT    Can store no more than 4 294 967 295 characters

Binaries:

TINYBLOB    Can store no more than 255 characters
BLOB        Can store no more than 65 535 characters
MEDIUMBLOB  Can store no more than 16 777 215 characters
LONGBLOB    Can store no more than 4 294 967 295 characters

BINARY      Similar to CHAR, but contains binary string rather than nonbinary string
VARBINARY   Similar to VARCHAR, but contains binary string rather than nonbinary string

Date and Time:

YEAR        1-byte type used to represent year values
DATE        Displays DATE values in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format
            Range is '1000-01-01' to '9999-12-31'
TIME        Displays TIME values in 'HH:MM:SS' format
            Range from '-838:59:59' to '838:59:59'
DATETIME    Contain both date and time parts and displays DATETIME values
            in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' format
            Range is '1000-01-01 00:00:00' to '9999-12-31 23:59:59'
TIMESTAMP   Contain both date and time parts
            Range of '1970-01-01 00:00:01' UTC to '2038-01-19 03:14:07' UTC

Others:

ENUM        string object with a value chosen from a list of permitted values
            that are enumerated explicitly in the column specification
            at table creation time (One of permitted)

SET         string object that can have zero or more values, each of which
            must be chosen from a list of permitted values specified
            when the table is created (Few of permitted)

JSON        As of MySQL 5.7.8, MySQL supports a native JSON data type
            that enables efficient access to data in JSON
